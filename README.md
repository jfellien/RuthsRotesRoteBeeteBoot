# RuthsRotesRoteBeeteBoot
This is a repo just for the Global Game Jam 2023

## Game play
The subject was "Roots". So we decided to create within 48 hours a small game with a custom controller.

In the game you control the boat of Ruth to collect beetroots.

## Controller
The custom Gamecontroller is a ESP32 Board connected with a MPU-6050 Sensor. Only the acceleration data will be used for steering.
